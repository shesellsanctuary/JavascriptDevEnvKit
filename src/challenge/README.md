## Challenge 2

Create an application/html page that displays fields on a map.
The fields information is available in file [_Fields.json_](./Fields.json), as GeoJson format.
Each field has different shapes and properties, which should be displayed visually. You are free to choose the way you find more appropriate to display the info.

The application should also be able to consume weather information for each field from a third-party API, in this case, [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). You can find examples on how to call the API [here](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5).

As a starting point to get some ideas (and also to compare your own results afterwards), you may take a look at [GeoJson.io](http://geojson.io). You can simply copy and paste the content of [_Fields.json_](./Fields.json) there and see how fields are displayed on the map.

You can use any map tool you would like. Some examples are Google Maps and Leaflet (which is the one we use :)).
Both of these providers have examples to get you started:

[Loading GeoJson using Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/)
